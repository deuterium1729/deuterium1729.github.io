Hello. I am Daniel Cao, an undergraduate at Cornell, majoring in computer science, mathematics, and statistics. My research interests include machine learning, reinforcement learning, diffusion models, and natural language processing. It's my great honor and pleasure to work with [Professor Chris de Sa](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cdesa) and [Professor Thorsten Joachims](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/) at Cornell University on distributed gradient balancing and optimal policy evaluation in contexual bandits, and [Professor Volodymyr Kuleshov](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kuleshov/) at Cornell Tech on continuous time-discrete diffusion models and Non-autoregressive Conditional Diffusion Models. I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer Intern this summer 2023 at Mr. Cooper Inc. I plan to work at IBM Research as a Software Engineer Intern this Summer 2024 with a focus on Foundation Models for Sequential Decision Making & Goal Driven Behavior. I am still in the process of looking for an Internship winter 2024 in AI or machine learning. 

I am interested in providing theoretical insight and confirmation in the development of new machine learning algorithms to provide better solutions for open questions in machine learning in terms of computational complexity and efficiency. To this end, I seek to explore the concerns of modern machine learning and how it can be improved by theoretically principled algorithms. I hope to bridge various fields of deep reinforcement learning, supervised learning, adversarial machine learning, and computer vision to find elegant results that work even in complex real world settings.

In my free time, I enjoy listening to classical music and playing viola. I also enjoy going on long hikes, biking, nature and landscape photography, modern history, and playing golf and frisbee.
