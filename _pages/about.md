Hello. I am Daniel Cao, an undergraduate at Cornell, majoring in computer science, mathematics, and statistics. My interests include machine learning systems, reinforcement learning, AI for Science, and natural language processing. It's a great honor to work with [Professor Chris de Sa](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cdesa) on quantization and parameter efficient fine tuning methods and [Professor Thorsten Joachims](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/) at Cornell University on distributed gradient balancing and optimal policy evaluation in prompt optimization. I am interested in providing theoretical insight on top of empirical results to aid in the development of computationally efficient and trustworthy LLM's. I hope to bridge various discoveries across optimization theory, computer vision, and random matrix theory into robust frameworks that help society better use modern ML.

In my free time, I enjoy listening to classical music and playing viola. I also enjoy going on hikes, nature and landscape photography, modern history, and playing frisbee.
